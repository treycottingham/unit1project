      <h3>Flexbox Froggy Feb 13th</h3>
      <h4>Setting the Stage</h4>
      <p>This is a video of my desktop being cleared to allow me to focus on Flexbox Froggy.  <a href="https://youtu.be/iUNx7X41gmY">Click Here</a>.  I am going to focus on beating the Flexbox Froggy game that teaches Flexbox in an interactive way. I want to learn to use this feature to position elements in the browser using CSS. The process consists of systematically completing each of the 24 levels in this tutorial. There may also be some googling to help give more context to the commands I give Flexbox.</p>
      <h4>Reflection</h4>
      <p>I was able to easily complete the tutorial and now understand Flexbox much better. Having a blank desktop with just one open window helped me remain on task and not get distracted. I plan to use the experience to continue to build websites with content positioned the way that I want it to be.</h5>
      <h3>Working w/ HTML/CSS Feb 15th</h3>
      <h4>Setting the Stage</h4>
      <p>This is a video of me setting the stage. <a href="https://youtu.be/5offarEnfv4">Click Here</a> .  I clear my desktop and open a fullscreen display of the code I will be working on.  Today I am working on HTML and CSS, I am completing the building-basic-websites assignments.  I am specifically working on positioning content on the page with Flexbox which is something I need practice with.</p>
      <h4>Reflection</h4>
      <p>My basic websites have been submitted and I am confident that they will pass.  I wasable to position all my content with Flexbox and floats without much issue.  I used resources on the Galvanize Learn page as well as tutorials I found online.  Setting the stage allowed me to focus fully on the task at hand, as there were no distractions.  Next up, I want to get my final project for this section done which uses the same principles as in this drill.</p>
      <h3>Solving Problems w/ JS Feb 22nd</h3>
      <h4>Setting the Stage</h4>
      <p>Today, I set the stage by clearing my desktop, leaving open only my code and a tutorial on Galvanize Learn.  I included a video here. <a href="https://youtu.be/FuApMi1_fSg">Click Here</a>. I will go through this tutorial on variables and data types and use the experience to help me progress towards completing my "solving problems with js" drills.</p>
      <h4>Reflection</h4>
      <p>Setting the stage helped me focus on two things: learning more about using JS and utilizing this knowledge to help me complete the drills I have yet to do. I learned a lot by using the NPM test and am seeing that an error message can be more instructional than doing something right the first try.  I am excited to see how JS can solve real world problems in a meaningful way.</p>

      <h2>Goal Setting</h2>
      <h3>Feb 8 2018</h3>
      <h4>Goals for the day: Complete build-websites-3 and beat Flexbox Froggy</h4>
      <p>I will complete build-basic-websites-3 by using flexbox and CSS styling to create a working restaurant website by 4PM. Using both online resources such as MDN and instructor input via the queue, I will finish the website.  Reflection:  I did not end up finishing on time. I went to too many breakouts and did not budget my time well. I did get to spend a lot of time on my CSS and semantic HTML and those both look much better at the end of the day as a result of my efforts, but I still have more work to do, so I guess I missed the "A" in SMART by not setting an attainable goal.  I will complete all 24 levels of the Flexbox Froggy interactive game by lunch time today. I will accomplish this task by taking a break from other activities every half hour and completing 6 of the exercises at a time until I have completed it. Reflection:  I did not do a good job of reminding myself to play. I should have set a timer on my phone or in my browser to remind me to play, but I still accomplished my task, at the expense of getting other work done in the half hour leading up to lunch. I included a screenshot of me completing the game as flexbox-complete.png in this repo.</p>
      <h4>What will I do differently tomorrow? Tomorrow I will budget my time better by setting timers to remind me when I need to be working on a certain task, or switching tasks altogether. Reflection:  I was able to easily complete the tutorial and now understand Flexbox much better. Having a blank desktop with just one open window helped me remain on task and not get distracted. I plan to use the experience to continue to build websites with content positioned the way that I want it to be.</h4>
      <h3>Feb 13 2018</h3>
      <h4>Goals for the day: My first set-short-term-goals practice resulted in minor failures on both goals because I was not timely and one of my goals was not attainable within the timeframe I set for it. Today I will set more manageable goals and outline how I will achieve them in a timely manner.</h4>
      <p>Firebase Practice. I am not very comfortable with Firebase and had some help from an instructor to help me get through the first part of that assignment, so for today, my goal is to familiarize myself with Firebase. Specifically, I want to be able to deploy a site without outside help. I will achieve this by watching the videos that Peter posted on our slack channel and going through the second section of the firebase assignments.  Reflection:  I deployed my second firebase assignment successfully. I did so by watching the videos and following along as I went. I actually understand why I am entering certain code in the command line because the instructor goes through the steps in detail.  Galvanize Money Practice. I am relatively comfortable with JS basics, but need more practice. I will complete the drill in the Galvanize-money repo by the end of the day. I will further this goal by attending the breakout on this subject today at 11am.  Reflection: I did not manage to complete the drill, however I made it through 1 of the 7 tests using npm. I learned a lot about node dependencies in addition to getting re-learning how to access objects with JS. This is a much more complicated assignment than I initially believed. It will take at least one more breakout for me to be able to work through all the new JS functions that I have not yet been able to learn. I will take another crack at this assignment tomorrow and itemize the steps I need to take to complete the challenge.</p>
      <h4>Tomorrow I will look into the goals I set and make sure that my goals are not too ambitious. For tomorrow, one of my goals will be to clear one of the additional errors in the Galvanize Money Practice assignment.</h4>
      <h3>Feb 14 2018</h3>
      <h4>Goals for the day: Update LinkedIn profile and plan my lightening talk.</h4>
      <p>I will update my LinkedIn profile by end of day. -Steps- Update email address, current occupation, profile picture, banner picture, current city. -Reflection- I understand that this is not necessarily a tech-learning activity, but this is an important thing for me to be up to date on if I am to use it as a networking tool for meetups. I was able to accomplish this task easily because my steps were all listed out beforehand and so I just checked them off as I went.  I will put together an outline of my lightening talk today. -Steps- Decide on topic, paper outline of slide topics, research topic, find appropriate photos, create a strong introduction slide, explain why I am interested in topic, give context and inform on subject, wrap up presentation. -Reflection- I have finished more than just an outline, but have put together my entire presentation, now my next step is to polish my presentation and practice my speech. Today was much more successful than my last two goal setting days.</p>
      <h4>Tomorrow I will focus on more learning-based objectives, although I think focusing on soft-skills and networking was a good use of my time today. My only failure was that I did not write a lot of code or attend any breakouts today.</h4>

      <h2>Meetups</h2>
      <h3>Feb 13 2018</h3>
      <h4>Meetup Information</h4>
      <h5>Denver Devs Happy Hour: Feb 13 2018</h5>
      <h4>People I Met</h4>
      <h5>Brandon Murphy - Customer Success Manager - Cypress; Samir Naik - Software Developer - Plaid; Scott - Software Developer - Strava.</h5> 
      <h4>What I Learned</h4>
      <p>This was my first ever meetup, so I learned a good bit. I learned that people in the tech community that attend these events are pretty friendly, fun people who are easy to talk to. I spoke with two different people whose companies are moving from San Francisco which is evidence that Denver's tech industry is continuing to grow. It surprised me how easy it was to talk about tech jobs and the industry. I thought that I would not be able to hold a conversation about most topics that potential employers would bring up. Being called out for talking about something I didn't know about had been keeping me from going to these meetups until I actually felt confident that I was knowledgeable about the tech industry and my future within it. It turns out, I know enough to understand and have an intelligent conversation with others in the industry which makes me more confident moving forward.</p> 
      <h4>Questions I Have</h4>
      <p>What are topics that are currently brought up by people at networking events that really turn off potential employers? Are there jobs that can be managed by full time students?</p>
      <h3>Feb 27 2018</h3>
      <h4>Meetup Information</h4>
      <h5>Web App Security Meetup</h5>
      <h4>People I Met</h4>
      <h5>Erich Hartnett - Head of Recruitment - SecureSet; Serge Borso - SpiderSec CEO</h5>
      <h4>What I Learned</h4>
      <p>I learned how to access hidden files within the browser.  I did not realize that it was so easy (and free) to download software that allows for penetration testing.  We used a software called Burp to intercept the communication between the server and the browser of the person accessing the data.  We used this tool as well as metadata to find out such things as location, salary info, and social security numbers for employees in a fake company whose files were poorly hidden.</p>
      <h4>Questions I Have</h4>
      <p>How can our program lead to a career in CyberSecurity.  What languages are used in penetration testing or how much fluency must you have in different languages in order to be a decent hacker?</p>
      <h3>March 13 2018</h3>
      <h4>Meetup Information</h4>
      <h5>Denver Devs Happy Hour</h5>
      <h4>People I Met</h4>
      <h5>Lane Faison - iOS Developer; Gabriel Armisen - Web Development Freelancer</h5>
      <h4>What I Learned</h4>
      <p>I learned a lot from my conversation with Lane. He was in G38 and I spoke with him about what path he took after graduation or if he had any advice. He said that it is important to find an area of interest and delve into it more thoroughly than your classmates. He studied iOS and Swift development and it set him apart from his classmates and made it much easier for him to get a job after graduating.</p>
      <h4>Questions I have</h4>
      <p>Are there any instructors at Galvanize who have a background in mobile development? Does career services help students specialize in certain areas of development or is that for us to find out?</p>
